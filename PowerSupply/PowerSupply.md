# Power Supply

The Power Supply is based in this two designs:

![ThreeNeurons](threeneurons.gif?raw=true)

and

![Instructables](instructables.jpg?raw=true)

Found in theses two links: [threeneurons](https://threeneurons.wordpress.com/nixie-power-supply/) and [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/High-Voltage-Power-Supply-for-Nixie-and-Valve-Tube/)

Unfortunately I don't have a schematic from the actual Power Supply.
